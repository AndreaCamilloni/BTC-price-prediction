# BTC-price-prediction
## Abstract 
Since the launch of Bitcoin in 2009, cryptocurrencies have gained a
lot of popularity, due to a rapid growth of their market capitalization
and the vast range of opportunities they offer. Cryptocurrencies prices
are however difficult to forecast, due to their volatility and dynamism.
This study tries to construct a robust predictive tool, focusing on Bitcoin
closing price. Three models are proposed: two of them exploit Long Short
Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, one trained on raw prices and the
other on stazionarized prices, whereas the third one is based on Support
Vector Regression algorithm

## Setup
